    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      DevTools Center ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy 
      explains how we handle information when you use our website and tools at devtoolscenter.com (the "Service").
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
      All tools on DevTools Center operate entirely in your web browser. This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your data is processed locally on your device</li>
      <li>No data you enter into our tools is transmitted to our servers</li>
      <li>We do not store, collect, or have access to any data you process using our tools</li>
      <li>Your data never leaves your browser</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>Analytics</h3>
    <p>
      We may use analytics services to understand how visitors use our website. These services may collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pages you visit</li>
      <li>Time spent on pages</li>
      <li>Browser type and version</li>
      <li>Device information</li>
      <li>General location (country/city level)</li>
      <li>Referrer information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We use privacy-focused analytics that do not track you across websites or use cookies for tracking.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Cookies and Local Storage</h3>
    <p>
      We use browser local storage to save your preferences, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dark/light theme preference</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is stored only in your browser and is never transmitted to our servers.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our website is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Cloudflare may collect certain information as part of 
      their hosting services. Please refer to 
      <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400">

      </a> 
      for more information.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since all tool processing happens in your browser and we don't collect or store your data, 
      there is minimal security risk. Your data security is primarily dependent on your device and 
      browser security.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to access your data</li>
      <li>The right to request deletion of your data</li>
      <li>The right to opt-out of certain data processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since we don't collect or store personal data through our tools, there is typically no data to 
      access or delete. For analytics data, you can use browser extensions or privacy settings to 
      block tracking.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information 
      from children under 13.
    </p>

      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by 
      posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
