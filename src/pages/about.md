    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      DevTools Center was created to provide developers worldwide with fast, free, and secure tools 
      for everyday development tasks. We believe that essential developer utilities should be accessible 
      to everyone, without barriers, registration requirements, or hidden costs.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Why DevTools Center?</h2>
    
    <h3>🔒 Privacy First</h3>
    <p>
      All our tools run entirely in your web browser. Your data never leaves your device, and we don't 
      store or transmit any information you process. This ensures maximum privacy and security for your 
      sensitive development work.
    </p>
    
    <h3>⚡ Lightning Fast</h3>
    <p>
      By processing everything client-side, our tools provide instant results without server round-trips. 
      This means faster performance and the ability to work even when offline.
    </p>
    
    <h3>🌍 Always Free</h3>
    <p>
      We're committed to keeping all our tools free forever. No subscriptions, no paywalls, no premium 
      tiers. Just pure, unadulterated developer utilities available to everyone.
    </p>
    
    <h3>🎨 Modern Design</h3>
    <p>
      We believe tools should be both functional and beautiful. Our clean, minimalist design with dark 
      mode support makes it easy to focus on your work, whether you're coding at noon or midnight.
    </p>
